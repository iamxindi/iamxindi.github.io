    <h1>Assessing Accessibility</h1>
    <h2>Site: https://campusinfo.umich.edu/ </h2>
    <h2>Role: Designer</h2>
    <h3>Accessibility Checklist</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i>Make sure there is enough contrast between text and its background color</li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i>Don't indicate important information using color alone</li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i>Pair values of colors together (not only hues) to increase contrast</li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i>Don't rely on sensory characteristics as the sole indicator for understanding and operating content</li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i>Design focus states to help users navigate and understand where they are</li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i>Help users understand inputs, and help them avoid and correct mistakes</li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i>Write good alt text for your images</li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i>If an experience cannot be made accessible, create another route for users to get that information</li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i>Be as consistent and clear as possible in layout and copy</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Increase contrast for text with a background.</strong> <br>
        For example, on the banner, the text "We are moving" is white on a yellow background.
        The low contrast might cause problem to readibility. Consider changing the text color to darker colors. <br>
        On "featured events", the link "RSVP here" is blue text on a black background. It can not be
      easily recognized. Consider changing the text color to white. </li>
      <li><strong>Write informative alt text for images </strong><br>
      While all images have alt text, they are not informative enough. For example, in the featured event section,
      the alt text of the pictures are the same as the event title below. For users who actually rely on alt text, it
    doesn't tell what is in the picture. Consider writing the alt text in a more descriptive way. </li>
      <li> <strong>Design better focus state</strong><br>
        While the links on the page have a focus state, most of them are just underlines and slight difference in background color,
        which is not distinguishable enough. Consider designing a more distinguishable focus state to help the users
        navigate the site.
      </li>
    </ul>
